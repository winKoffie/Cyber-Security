# Risk Management
## Understanding risks
- Internal Risks: Arise from **within** the organization.
- External Risks: Arise from **outside** the organization.
- Multiparty Risks: Affect **more than one** organization.
- Intellectual property therft : poses a risk to **knowleage-based** organizations.
- Software license compliance: issues risk fines and legal action.


## Risk assessment
Risk assessment **identifies** and **triages** risks.

- **Threats**: are external forces that jeopardize security.
- **Vulnerabilities**: are weaknesses in your security controls.
- **Risks** : are the combination of a threat and a vulnerability.

Risks rank by **Likelihood** and **Impact**.
- **Likelihood**: is the probability a risk will occur.
- **Impact**: is the amount of damamge a risk will cause.

we have two different categories of technique that we can use to assess the likelihood and Impact of a risk.
1. Qualitative Risk Assessment: Uses subjective ratings to evaluate risk likelihood and impact.

2. Quantitative Risk Assessment: Uses Objective numeric ratings to evaluate risk likelihood and impact.


## Risk treatment
Risk treatment analyzes and implements possible responses to control risk.

Risk Treatment Options
1. Risk avoidance
	- Risk avoidance changes business practices to make a risk irrelevant.
2. Risk transference
	- Risk treatment analyzes and implements possible responses to control risk.
3. Risk mitigation
	- Risk mitigation reduces the likelihood or impact of a risk.
4. Risk acceptance
	- Risk acceptance is the choice to continue operations in the face of a risk.

## Selecting security controls
Security controls reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk and help identify issues.

Two different ways of security controls
1. Control Purpose
	1. Preventive
		- Preventive controls stop a security issue from occcurring.
	2. Detective
		- Detective controls identify security issues requiring investigation.
	3. Corrective
		- Recovery controls remediate security issues that have occurred.
2. Control Mechanism
	1. Technical
		- use technology to achieve control objectives.
	2. Administrative
		- use processes to achieve control objectives.
	3. Physical
		- Impact the physical world.
		

## Configuration managment
Tracks specific device settings
- Baselines: Provide a configuration snapshot.
- Versioning: Assigns numbers to each varsion.
- Diagrams serve as important configuration artifacts.
- Standardize Device Configurations
	- Naming conventions
	- IP adderessing schemes
- Change and management help ensure a stable operating environment.
